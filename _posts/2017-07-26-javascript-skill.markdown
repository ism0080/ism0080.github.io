Javascript *(ECMAScript 5)*

Through the use of JavaScript I have done many assignments that have covered a variety of uses for JavaScript. This includes a [Maze Game][maori-game] and a Graphic Visualisation Animation.

**Maze Game** *[GitHub][git-maori-game]* \\
A variant of the Eloquent JavaScript canvas version platform game.

**Sunrise Animation** *[GitHub][git-maori-sunrise]* \\
The animation used pretty much the same code files as the game but without user input.
